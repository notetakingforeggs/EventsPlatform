# Use layer first directory structure on both front and backend 
---

### Context
I was doing the backend structure as taught on the course, trying to wrap my head around front end architecture and realised there are two competing file strcutures to chooose from

### Decision
I am going to choose Layer first
### Alternatives Considered
Feature first is apparently better for bigger apps, as it allows higher cohesion within packages, and loose coupling between them. see: https://medium.com/sahibinden-technology/package-by-layer-vs-package-by-feature-7e89cde2ae3a 
### Consequences
Although perhaps less optimal, I hope Layer first will help me get a better understanding of the MVVM structure
### Status
- Accepted
