# Use ADR for tracking design decisions

### Context
In previous projects, I have often had scatterred documentation of various design decisions, sometimes inline comments, sometimes in the readme. 

### Decision
To record all significant design decisions in md files in this ADR directory

### Alternatives Considered
A combination of ad-hoc records across google docs, obsidian, inline comments and in the readme

### Consequences
Ideally, a clear and concise record of all decisions made during the planning and implementing phases of this project, allowing both myself and other to understand why certain things are the way they are, and to more easily improve both this project, and future projects

### Status
Initialised
