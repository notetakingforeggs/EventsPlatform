Misc "to do" list
---
- Create AppUser DTO rather than passing full users around
- Create error handlers to gracefully handle exceptions etc
- FIgure out that thing about how jpa repository has automatic methods depending on class attributes?
- set up postman/curl some endpoints
- create an sql seed/init for testing purposes
- refresh why using Long not long for ids
- decide naming conventions: appuser always?#
- also in service class, specify events or know it will be like eventservieimpl.getById so dont need twice events?
- need to robustify methods in service impls, especially update. feels jank rn.
- need to solidify what "id" is gonna be, as i think it is currently autogenned by the orm. is that an issue?q
