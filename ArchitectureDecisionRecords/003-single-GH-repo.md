# Using a single repo for all files related to project
---

### Context
There is a need to organise my project files, and implement version control and remote access
### Decision
Creating a single repo on github to contain both frontend and backend, and any other parts of the project
### Alternatives Considered
Individual repos for frontend and backend
### Consequences
As the sole developer on the project, it feels less vital to separate these out. I am hoping it will also simplify CI/CD when I get there.
### Status
- Accepted
